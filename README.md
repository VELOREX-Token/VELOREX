What is VELOREX?
Velorex (VEX) is a decentralized finance token built on the BEP-20 platform. At Velorex we aim to facilitate global adoption of our cryptocurrency by introducing Debit Cards and Smart Wallets that dynamically interact with a variety of web3.0 and related programs within our block-chain from 2022 onward.

Currently, our primary focus is geared towards the implementation of the VEX token into a real world application in the form of essential innovative decentralized services. This will be realized by the ‘VEXchange’ which is being developed concurrently and will enable our users to experience low cost, high speed purchasing of products & procurement of services throughout the global online marketplace while providing a decentralized payment gateway, transfer protocol and asset storage capability for VEX token.
